Introduction

Trail Forecaster allows you to easily find hiking trails in your area. With one click, you are able to see a description of the trail you are interested in, directions, the current weather, the past 3 days weather, and the weather forecast for the next 3 days. Finally, there is an app that allows users to determine if a trail will be muddy, dusty, be full of puddles, or have freshly fallen snow. A more knowledgable hiker is a better prepared hiker and a safer hiker.

MrktTracker was designed to help Retail Sales Specialists and other similar professions, track data for stores they visit. Through the inputting of certain data, the user can use this app to keep track of information about store locations, important store personnel, store preferences, and the tracking of a store's paperwork.

MrktTracker allows users to create an account. Once the user is logged in, he/she can view each store along with its tier and address. Future updates will enable user to change account information, view addition data about each store, and edit the store. 

Technical

This app was built HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. In order to maintain data between logins, this app has 2 APIs: a store API and a user API.
